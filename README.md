# LeetCode & C++ Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository for documenting my progress in learning C++ and solving problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). This project serves as a personal tracker for my coding skills, where I’ll log solutions, notes, and reflections as I work through LeetCode questions and deepen my understanding of C++.

Before starting this repository, I had already solved **11 LeetCode questions**. This repo picks up from there, capturing my ongoing journey to improve problem-solving and master C++.

---

## Goals
- Solve LeetCode problems across various difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).
- Practice and refine C++ programming skills, including data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented concepts.
- Document solutions with explanations and optimize them over time.
- Track progress and milestones (e.g., every 10 problems solved).

---

## Repository Structure
- **`solutions/`**: Contains C++ files for each LeetCode problem, named by problem number and title (e.g., `1_two-sum.cpp`).
- **`notes/`**: PDF files with C++ concepts, tips, or reflections from my learning.
- **`progress.md`**: A log of completed problems, dates, and brief notes on challenges or insights.

---

## Progress
- **Starting Point**: 11 problems solved pre-repository.
- **Current Count**: [Update this as you go!]
- Check my LeetCode stats below for a visual summary:

## How I Work
1. **Pick a Problem**: Choose from LeetCode’s problem set based on topic (e.g., arrays, trees) or difficulty.
2. **Solve in C++**: Write a solution in C++, aiming for clarity and efficiency.
3. **Test Locally**: Compile and test on my Intel-based Mac using `clang++` (e.g., `clang++ -std=c++17 solution.cpp -o solution`).
4. **Commit**: Add the solution to `solutions/` and update `progress.md`.
5. **Reflect**: Note any new C++ tricks or algorithmic insights in `notes/`.
